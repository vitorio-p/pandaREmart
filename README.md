## Problem

Users that routinely purchase the same few items from pandamart are unable to automate the process. They have to enter the same few items, their datetime of delivery, and make payments manually.

## Solution

Users will be able to set a pandaREmart, a feature to enable users to automatically set a route pandamart order. They will be able to edit or delete the pandaREmart. Users will be able to set the frequency duration (e.g., every 2 weeks).

## Scope

For now, we will only be able to order from darkmall (pandamart) strictly.

## Case Scenario

User would like to order milk and rice from pandamart every 2 weeks, to be delivered on the first and third Sunday at 12pm. Once the user sets up the pandaREmart, the app will automatically submit a pandamart order on the first and third Sunday at 10am, so that the user will be able to receive his items at 12pm.

## Tech Stacks

To be updated.
